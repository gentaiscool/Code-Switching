    <h1 id="what-is-code-switching">What is Code Switching?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Code-switching (CS) is the phenomenon by which multilingual speakers switch back and forth between their common languages in written or spoken communication.</li>
  <li>CS is typically present on the intersentential, intrasentential (mixing of words from multiple languages in the same utterance) and even morphological (mixing of morphemes) levels.</li>
  <li>CS presents serious challenges for language technologies such as Parsing, Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE), and semantic processing.</li>
  <li>Traditional techniques trained for one language quickly break down when there is input mixed in from another language.</li>
  <li>Even for problems that are considered solved for specific domains and languages, such as language identification, or part of speech tagging, performance degrades at a rate proportional to the amount and level of the mixed-language present.</li>
</ul>
